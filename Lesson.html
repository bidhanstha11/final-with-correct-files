            <h1>Lessons learnt from Elon musk</h1>
        <h3>Just be eccentric</h3>
        <p>Elon Musk is known as an eccentric, and he both accepts that label and seems to use it. Over the last few years
            alone, he’s proposed setting off nuclear bombs on Mars to make it habitable, that showering is the key to his
            success, and has guest-starred on the Big Bang Theory as himself. As a child, Elon Musk was badly bullied for
            his differences. Now he uses them to move his business forward and even to have a little fun in his life. This
            is a great lesson for life that sometimes the things that set you apart as a child can become your greatest
            strengths as an adult.Have you been hiding, or part of yourself, for fear that people will judge or reject you?
            Perhaps it’s time to bring that part of yourself into the light and ignore those who criticize you.</p>
    
        <h3>Connect ideas</h3>
        <p>It can sometimes feel as if every idea has already been thought, every innovation made. But Elon Musk’s work
            shows the value of combining two disparate ideas to make something new. His work connects space travel with
            travel around the world, conservation with cars and the human brain with computers. Some of these ideas might
            seem off the wall, but they’re also incredibly innovative and will probably become a reality in the near or
            distant future.</p>
    
        <h3>Follow your interests</h3>
        <p>Elon Musk is interested in various things, and he has shamelessly followed those interests. His main field of
            interest is technology, but he’s used this interest to delve into the realms of space travel, the internet,
            sustainable energy and transportation. And with each of Elon’s interests, his empire has expanded, and even more
            importantly, he developed further his skill set.</p>
    
        <h3>Learn constantly</h3>
        <p>Learning shouldn’t end when you leave school or university, and Elon Musk is a fantastic example. He believes in
            constantly bettering himself, whether it’s through extensive reading, or by experimenting with new technologies
            and techniques. This habit is vitally important for business and life success. It’s shared by most extremely
            successful people and can easily and cheaply become a regular part of your daily schedule.</p>
    
        <h3>Assemble a great team</h3>
        <p>You can do it better with a great team no matter what you need to do. Elon Musk in this research says hiring the
            wrong person for a job can be catastrophic in terms of the amount of money and time wasted. It pays to interview
            new employees personally to make sure they are hired according to your requirements and vision.</p>
    
        <h3>Seek out criticism</h3>
        <p>Most people are afraid of criticism, but Elon Musk seeks it out to improve his business and his ideas. In his own
            words, he claims, “Constantly seek criticism. A well thought out critique of whatever you’re doing is as
            valuable as gold.” If taken in the right spirit, criticism can teach you what you’re lacking. It can show you
            the weaknesses you need to change. It can also be the difference between success and absolute failure in life
            and business.</p>
    
        <h3>Reason your way from zero</h3>
        <p>Elon Musk believes that you need to start from the beginning to solve a problem. This means stripping away
            conventional wisdom, things everybody knows and looking at it with new eyes. This is called the First Principles
            Mindset. His mindset is unique, powerful, and difficult to do. We all come with biases and assumptions,
            conscious or unconscious, and it can be nearly impossible to unearth and eliminate them from your
            decision-making process.</p>
