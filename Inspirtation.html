        <h2 class="inpsires-kina">Why he inspires me?</h2>
        <p class="part11">He is an inspiration to entrepreneurs, a visionary and innovative person determined to achieve his goals despite
            the obstacles in his way to positively impact the world. For example, his car company Tesla has steered the
            automotive industry towards semi-autonomous vehicles and electric cars, globally reducing vehicle emissions.
            Because of Musk, analysts now believe that over half the cars sold by 2040 will be electric. The public agrees
            with Musk's vision. A recent poll shows that almost 50% of people believe Tesla is the most innovative
            technology company today. The demand for their products confirms it. Since 2017, the company has sold more than
            350,000 of its Model 3 sedans, and, as reported in Oct 2019, Tesla has been manufacturing almost 100,000 cars
            per quarter.</p>
        <p class="part12">Even though, he is sometimes egomaniacal, self-destructive, and quixotic, like other imperfect idols like Steve
            Jobs. And he often devotes his resources towards projects that are arguably rooted in vanity. For example, his
            SpaceX Falcon Heavy Test Launch project - in which a Tesla sports car was launched into space - cost $90 million
            to execute, and didn't contribute to any scientific or humanitarian gains. Another example of his egomaniacal
            and self-destructive behaviour was recently given when he tweeted: "The coronavirus panic is dumb". This fact
            had a negative impact on the value of Tesla's stocks. With money and power often comes hubris, and it seems as
            though Musk isn't an exception to this rule.</p>
        <p class="part11">Despite all this, there is one thing we do not overlook, and that is that no one of our time has as much ambition
            and desire to change our day-to-day life as he does. He is always thinking about the future, trying to figure
            out what the future should be. As he has done with the automotive industry through Tesla. He also has his
            company SolarCity, which he is trying to strengthen the use of solar energy. Beyond Musk's undisputed genius and
            agility, it takes a lot of arrogance to dedicate life to pioneering technologies that promote the sustainability
            of the Earth.</p>
        <p class="part12">He tries to give top priority to his customers, and his product. He works hard to give hiscustomers the best
            experience and satisfy their needs. All this, through electric cars with all the features of a high-end car and
            that are also semi-autonomous that can assist disabled people in transportation. For example, the Tesla Model X
            has an autopilot that allows the vehicle to drive autonomously. And he always thinks about how to improve
            several aspects of our routine. Like example, he has projects like Hyperloop, to offer us travel in capsules
            through cylindrical ducts at low pressure, reaching speeds of 700 mph, reducing considerably the time of our
            trips to other cities. For another side, he can offer trips into space, thanks to his company SpaceX, for those
            who can afford it.</p>
        <p class="part11">Musk may be worthy of his glory for the innovative ideas and projects he has but developingthem has a cost, and
            he is not necessarily the one who pays this one. He has achieved greatgoals, but exploiting or coercing his work
            team. For example, SpaceX staff are often presented with impossible tasks pulling all-nighters after working
            12-hour days, to meet the deadlines Musk expects from them. In addition, his Tesla workers filed charges in 2017
            with the National Labour Board against him, citing coercion, hazardous working conditions, intimidation, illegal
            surveillance, and prevention of worker communications as their main reasons for doing so. It is true that with
            effort and dedication we can do great things but there must be a balance with good rest and conditions of work.
        </p>
        <p class="part12">However, Musk's companies have been pioneers in creating new technologies that help andsurprise the world. Musk
            has demonstrated that the space industry can be privatized, and for the better. His company SpaceX has seen the
            successful return of rockets back to Earth after being launched into space. It is Dragon more recently succeeded
            in delivering a capsule of supplies to the International Space Station. These show that privatization ventures
            maysignificantly reduce the costs of space exploration.</p>
        <p class="part11 halka-gap">
            In conclusion, Elon Musk is a great inspiration to the people that want to make changes in the world. Although
            he has some behaviours that can be destructive and reprehensible, we cannot forget that he is just a human-like
            any of us, full of mistakes and imperfections. Moreover, he has the desire to succeed, innovate, and help the
            environment, a combination that is very difficult to see. Even he knows how to deal with adversity and
            criticism. No one believed in him when he said he would launch rockets into space or make autonomous cars. Now,
            everyone can see how Elon Musk achieves each one of his goals.</p>
