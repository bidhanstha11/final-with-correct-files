                    <p>While the COVID-19 pandemic shattered the global economy in 2020 and put millions of people out of work,
                        Tesla’s stock price increased 700%, adding $140 billion to Musk’s net worth.Musk, CEO of Tesla, was an
                        early investor in the company that since became the king of the electric vehicle (EV) industry.But Tesla
                        soon may face serious competition from Volkswagen, which has jumped full force into the EV playing

                    <p>In a 58-page technical paper from 2013, Musk outlined his vision for a mode of transportation that could achieve
                        high speeds using a hovering pod that travels without friction or air resistance through a tubed system.He never
                        turned the idea into a company, but Virgin Hyperloop grabbed the ball in 2014 and ran with it. On Nov. 8, 2020,
                        the company’s experimental two-seater made a successful test run in the Nevada desert.Hyperloop Transportation
                        Technologies (U.S.), Hardt Hyperloop (Netherlands) and TransPod (Canada) are three other companies trying to
                        make hyperloop transportation a reality.</p>

                    <p>In 2015, Musk, along with German-American billionaire Peter Thiel and Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn,
                        launched Open AI, a nonprofit and open-source artificial intelligence research company. The three had worked
                        together in the early days of PayPal.In a 2014 interview at M.I.T., Musk described artificial intelligence as
                        our “biggest existential threat,” according to The New York Times.The aim of the new organization was to develop
                        artificial intelligence in a way that would have a positive effect on humanity, Musk told The Times.Musk
                        resigned from the OpenAI board in 2018, citing possible conflicts of interest with Tesla.</p>

                    <p>Musk launched Neuralink, a neurotechnology company, in 2016. His aim was to create brain-machine interfaces
                        linking living brains to human-made technology.The company says its initial goal is “to help people with
                        paralysis to regain independence through the control of computers and mobile devices.”Neuralink hopes its
                        technology might eventually be able to “treat a wide range of neurological disorders, to restore sensory and
                        movement function.”</p>
